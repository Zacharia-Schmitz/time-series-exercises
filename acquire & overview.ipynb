    "#### REST\n",
    "\n",
    "Representational State Transfer (REST) is a software architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating web services. RESTful web services allow clients to access and manipulate web resources using a uniform and predefined set of stateless operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### API\n",
    "\n",
    "An Application Programming Interface (API) is a set of protocols, routines, and tools for building software applications. In the context of time series analysis, APIs can be used to access and manipulate time series data from various sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### JSON\n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. JSON is commonly used for transmitting data between a server and a web application, and can be used to represent time series data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### URI\n",
    "\n",
    "Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a string of characters that identifies a name or a resource on the Internet. In the context of time series analysis, URIs can be used to identify and access time series data from various sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### CRUD\n",
    "\n",
    "CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete, which are the four basic functions of persistent storage. In the context of time series analysis, CRUD operations can be used to create, read, update, and delete time series data from a database or other storage system.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Temporal\n",
    "\n",
    "Temporal refers to the dimension of time in data. In the context of time series analysis, temporal data refers to data that is collected over time, such as stock prices, weather data, or sensor readings.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Periodic\n",
    "\n",
    "Periodic refers to data that exhibits a repeating pattern over time. In the context of time series analysis, periodic data can be modeled using techniques such as Fourier analysis or seasonal decomposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Resampling in Time Series\n",
    "\n",
    "Resampling in time series refers to the process of changing the frequency of a time series. This can involve upsampling (increasing the frequency of the data) or downsampling (decreasing the frequency of the data).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stationary Process\n",
    "\n",
    "A stationary process is a stochastic process whose statistical properties (such as mean and variance) do not change over time. In the context of time series analysis, stationary processes are often assumed in order to simplify modeling and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Trend\n",
    "\n",
    "Trend refers to the long-term pattern or direction of a time series. In the context of time series analysis, trends can be modeled using techniques such as linear regression or exponential smoothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Seasonality\n",
    "\n",
    "Seasonality refers to the repeating pattern of a time series over a fixed period of time (such as a day, week, or year). In the context of time series analysis, seasonality can be modeled using techniques such as seasonal decomposition or Fourier analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Heteroskedasticity\n",
    "\n",
    "Heteroskedasticity refers to the phenomenon where the variance of a time series changes over time. In the context of time series analysis, heteroskedasticity can complicate modeling and analysis, and may require techniques such as generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Autocorrelation\n",
    "\n",
    "Autocorrelation refers to the correlation between a time series and a lagged version of itself. In the context of time series analysis, autocorrelation can be used to identify patterns and dependencies in the data, and can be modeled using techniques such as autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models."
